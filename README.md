#Making Horiseon Visible

## Description

An initial run-through of the code for the Horiseon site revealed adequate functionality but a need for some clarifying organization and clean up.  Beginning with the HTML, I started by making sure the heading for the site had a name instead of simply “website”.  Further down to the main content of the site, I added alt descriptions for the images to make the browser more accessible and assistive.  The same thing was done for the images in the sidebar. 

Looking over the overall organization of the code in HTML, some clarification/specificity was needed to better identify the purpose of each section.  So, I changed the marker to <main> in the content section, and for the sidebar, chose to call it <aside> after looking at W3 schools for some helpful new semantic elements.  

Once the new elements were created in the HTML, I was able to consolidate some of the style elements in the stylesheet, and get rid of some of it altogether, so that we had a more concise stylesheet.  I also separated the different sections via comments to help organize the sheet better.  The site is now better staged for any additional enhancements and stylistic modifications Horiseon may request in the future.
